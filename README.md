List of Functions used:
1. averageScore: returns a value of the average score based on the entire list of students
2. sortedScore: used a sort function wrt student's scores, stored in an array, sorted in an array ascending order, from that one will get the highest scored student and least scored student with their respective names
3. gradeDistribution: declared all grade counts at the start, 0. Then implemented an iteration for each student details, there I used switch case statement, such as whose marks falls into the specific marks range, the count of the grade counts (made at the start) will be incremented by 1. If the score doesnt exist, then it will fall under F Grade, which will be default block. Default block will also add the names of the students who fall under the same category.

At the end, used console.log statements to display the required elements as per mentioned by the assignment.
